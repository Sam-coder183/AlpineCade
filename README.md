# AlpineCade, an open source Alpine Linux distro focused on retro gaming

## I made a new install of alpine linux and made a snapshot of the clean installation.

### I can't upload the vmware files directly to github because The files are too large, I will make a link to mega while I learn lfs so you can collaborate with me.


> Current goals
> 1. install retroarch and dependencies
> 2. install webrcade
> 3. 
 # Good luck to all Arcade Contestants! ğŸ˜Š
